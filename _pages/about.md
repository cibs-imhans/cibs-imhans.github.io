#### **About us**
The Center for Behavioral Neuroscience Research at Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (CBNR-IMHANS), Kerala is a flagship research center established to address fundamental and translational research questions in psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. The laboratories was set up as a part of the Centre of Excellence grant from the Government of India. Our research involves delineating genetic basis of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, elucidating the molecular pathogenesis from genetic leads, electrophysiological correlates of cognition and behavior, sleep deficits in psychiatric disorders.

#### **Research area:** 
We are interested in the discovery of novel genetic risk factors for neuropsychiatric diseases. We further aim to mechanistically evaluate the genetic risk factors by molecular, cellular, neurophysiological, and behavioural phenotyping to characterise molecular pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric diseases for druggable targets and biomarkers.

#### **Research Grants:**
* Science Research Scheme (SRS), Kerala State Council for Science, Technology & Environment (KSCSTE)- Elucidating the mechanistic role of sleep quality for elevated carbonyl stress in schizophrenia (PI: Rajith K Ravindren, Co-PI: Shabeesh Balan, Anish P K)
* Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India - Synergestic effect of genetic risk factor and the carbonyl stress in schizophrenia (PI: Shabeesh Balan , Co-PI: Rajith K Ravindren)
* State Board for Medical Research (SBMR), Kerala, India - Molecular genetics of Tourette Syndrome (PI: Rajith K Ravindren, Co-PI: Shabeesh Balan)
* State Board for Medical Research (SBMR), Kerala, India - Vitamin D deficiency in patients with schizophrenia and Autism (PI: Rajith K Ravindren, Co-PI: Midhun S, Krishnakumar P)

### **Diagnostic Services:**
* **Karyotyping:** Peripheral blood chromosomal analysis for detecting numerical and structural chromosome abnormalities.
* **Mutation Analysis:** Genotyping service for genetic variants.
* **Genetic counselling:** Genetic counselling services for patients and at-risk individuals.
