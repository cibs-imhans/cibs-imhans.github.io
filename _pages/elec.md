## **Genetic, Electrophysiological, and Sleep characterisation in familial somniloquy**

<img style="float: right;" src="/assets/software/somniloquy_ad.png" alt="drawing" width="400">

Greetings! The Neuroscience Research Laboratory at the **Centre for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences (CIBS)**, Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS), and Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College Kozhikode is undertaking a Department of Science & Technology (DST)-Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), (Government of India) funded research program on the **Genetic Characterisation of Somniloqouy**. We employ high-throughput genomic approaches to understand genetic architecture of sleep talking. We would like to seek your assistance in **referring individuals who talks in sleep** to the Centre for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences (CIBS), Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (IMHANS), Kozhikode for this research program.
